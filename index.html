    <p>
        It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to say<br>
        Sunshine she's here, you can take a break<br>
        <span>I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space</span><br>
        With the air, like I don't care baby by the way
    </p>

        Because I'm happy<br>
        Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof<br>
        <span>Because I'm happy</span><br>
        Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
